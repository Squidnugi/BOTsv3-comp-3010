# BOTsv3-comp-3010
Github for Henry McConville comp 3010 assignment on the splunk BOTsv3 database

Notes:
do due diligence, don't just get the answer evaluate it
look at Security Operations Center (soc) while writing, seems like understanding the questions and the answers found and soc is where the marks are
