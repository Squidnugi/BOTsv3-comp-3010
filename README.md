Introduction
This Security Operations Centre (SOC) report is for the Frothly food and beverage company on what their Splunk SIEM system has captured. The two primary sources that are being looked at are the AWS logs for the cloud side of this hybrid system and Windows Logs on the physical side of the system. The goal of this report is to look through these logs and identify any vulnerabilities that might appear, if those vulnerabilities have been utilised, what is the damage from those vulnerabilities and the recovery plan for the damage.
